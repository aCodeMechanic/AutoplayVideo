# AutoplayVideo
Android Start Up Service with Video

## Welcome

I am just trying to make basic apps using android components. In this particular app I have used a service and a default video player. Further, I am going to tell you how to use it.

## How to use?

I have given comments for better understandng. Besides that, it is very simple to understand. You just need to rename a video to mov_new.mp4 and put it in the device storage at "/downloads/mov_new.mp4" and you are good to go.

### Thanks for being here
### I really hope it helps the developers who have just started with android.
